        <h1>Kenneth Kiprotich</h1>
        <p>Hey! Glad you're here - I'm currently a sophomore year Computer Science student at Columbia University. I grew up in Kenya. I have always thought it is super cool to come up with an idea and just make it. Now I'm just trying to learn more about the world, think through real world problems, and do fun things with fun people.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>•  Innovation. I am actively trying to engage myself in exploring socially impactful entrepreneurial ideas</p>
        <p>•  Design and creativity. I have been exploring several types of designs (from shoe design to stage design). Creative design fascinates me, and lately, I have been trying to expore how creators come up with unconventional ideas. (Great fan of the documentary: Abstract: the Art of Design) </p>
        <p>•  <a href="https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/10/13/the-ai-art-at-christies-is-not-what-you-think">What makes art art?</a> Who are the tastemakers?</p>
        <p>•  Podcasts on tech, entrepreneurship, psychology, and discussion-based logical reasoning. One of my favorite podcasts is <a href="https://fs.blog/the-knowledge-project/"> "The Knowledge Project" </a> with Shane Parrish</p>
        <p>•  I am a sports fan. I follow the English Premier League side, Liverpool FC. I also find the intensity of  motorsports exciting, so I am a Formula 1 fan</p>

        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>•  Summer 2019- Software Developer Intern at BRCK: This summer (2019), I worked at <a href="https://www.brck.com/iot/"> BRCK </a>, an internet-of-things startup in Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
        <p>•  From May to June 2019, I worked on a personal project to introduce some low-income high school students in Kenya to coding. The inspiration to do this came mainly from my experience in my first computer science class in college. I attended a public high school without a CS curriculum in Kenya, and experienced first-hand the
          challenges that first-time coders have. To try and "solve" that, I decided to introdice a bunch of tech-enthusiastic kids to some coding!</p>
        <p>•  Columbia University Information Technology: I am a computer lab consultant, part of a team in charge of fixing student's and faculty's hardware and software problems at Columbia's tech hubs.</p>
        <p>•  Summer 2017- Online Banking Intern at Equity Bank:  Worked in a team of four to guide clients through joining the bank’s mobile network and online banking suites so as to ease real- time inter-bank money transfers while also enabling communication through a mobile network. Gained marketing and communication skills from interacting with clients and team members.</p>
        <p>•  Community Needs Assessment: I participated in a needs assessment in Rift Valley area of Kenya, to determine factors that influence the economy of the area.</p>
