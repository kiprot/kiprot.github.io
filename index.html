        <p>
            From May to June 2019, I worked on a personal project to introduce some low-income high school 
            students in Kenya to coding. The inspiration to do this came mainly from my experience in my first 
            computer science class in college. I attended a public high school without a CS curriculum in Kenya, 
            and experienced first-hand the challenges that first-time coders have. To try and "solve" that, 
            I decided to introdice a bunch of tech-enthusiastic kids to some coding!
